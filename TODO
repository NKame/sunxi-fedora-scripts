-F19-r1
 -Must:
  -add rootfs resiz, also see :
   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=974631
  -relabel fs
  -update README: F19, update boards list, document a20 caveats?
 -Should
  -A20 support
  -add network config support
  -get wifi on auxtek-t004 to work
 -NTH:
  -add rc.local to tweak cpufreq? :
   http://linux-sunxi.org/Cpufreq
  -look into usb devices not working on A10s without hub ?
  -look into A10s reboot issue (seen on mk802_a10s at 1920x1200)
  -look into high load issue

-A20 support
 -Must:
  -dma compat
  -add sound support
  -fix / check emac mac-addr code for doing the proper thing with an all 0 sid
  -add emac support
  -add sata support
 -NTH:
  -better sched_clock (currently using jiffies), try using arch_timer one,
   otherwise use timer.c one ?
  -add nand support
  -all other pheriphals
  -Add CONFIG_SUNXI_MULTIPLATFORM Kconfig support
  -Switch to plat include dir?

-rtc-sun4i, make BACKUP_PWM a runtime check based on ic ver

-A10s gpio-int:
 https://github.com/amery/linux-sunxi/commit/e94c07323b3667130eedf1f833c12ccb80fd820d
 Need to fix in gpio-sunxi.c as well

-take photos of devices + create wiki pages so people can easily identify
 which device they have

-look into ir support

-install to HD
-install to NAND

-lower fbmem, disable double buffer by default. Freeing 10 MB (useful on
 low mem devices mostly)

-use proper functions to calucalate mult + shift for timers
-see if we can do a better sched_clock and clocksource
 -use 32 bit timer in auto-reload with reload of 0xffffffff, use
  it as a counter.
 -call gettimeofday from a slow timer to ensure wraps get detected
 -current clocksource can cause us to run with interrupts disabled for 17%
  of the time, see "perf top" output

-rebase rootfs-resize patch, mail to ctyler

-try 16bpp framebuffer -> better performance ?

-mali clock div is too low in many fex files when not using PLL6 for PLL4

-checkout wemac performance issues, see archived mail

-Silence kernel debug spew in general
