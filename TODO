 -rootfs resize not included / broken? See :
 https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=974631

-A10s gpio-int:
 https://github.com/amery/linux-sunxi/commit/e94c07323b3667130eedf1f833c12ccb80fd820d
 Need to fix in gpio-sunxi.c as well

-add rc.local to tweak cpufreq? :
 http://linux-sunxi.org/Cpufreq

-look into usb devices not working on A10s without hub ?

-take photos of devices + create wiki pages so people can easily identify
 which device they have

-look into high load issue

-look into ir support

-install to HD
-install to NAND

-use proper functions to calucalate mult + shift for timers
-see if we can do a better sched_clock and clocksource
 -use 32 bit timer in auto-reload with reload of 0xffffffff, use
  it as a counter.
 -call gettimeofday from a slow timer to ensure wraps get detected
 -current clocksource can cause us to run with interrupts disabled for 17%
  of the time, see "perf top" output

-rebase rootfs-resize patch, mail to ctyler

-try 16bpp framebuffer -> better performance ?

-mali clock div is too low in many fex files when not using PLL6 for PLL4

-checkout wemac performance issues, see archived mail

-Silence kernel debug spew in general
