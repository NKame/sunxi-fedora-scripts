-check r7 with latest u-boot, interrupt at first boot, check power and led
-silence wifi spew!!
-add missing boards to u-boot sunxi-current
-fix kernel-config
-add new boards to build + select-board
-give up on making select-board.sh work with sh, make it require bash and
 update docs on this
-add inet97f-ii to select-board.sh, it is in build-boot-root but not in
 select-board
-create image
-upload
-release a new F-18 image with A10s support !!

-A10s gpio-int:
 https://github.com/amery/linux-sunxi/commit/e94c07323b3667130eedf1f833c12ccb80fd820d

-take photos of devices + create wiki pages so people can easily identify
 which device they have

-try to get more leds working

-look into high load issue
-look into interlaced without scaler maybe scnwin vs srcwin issue ?

-use proper functions to calucalate mult + shift for timers
-see if we can do a better sched_clock and clocksource
 -use 32 bit timer in auto-reload with reload of 0xffffffff, use
  it as a counter.
 -call gettimeofday from a slow timer to ensure wraps get detected
 -current clocksource can cause us to run with interrupts disabled for 17%
  of the time, see "perf top" output

-implement a uboot reset for A13 that actually works (use the wdt)

-rebase rootfs-resize patch, mail to ctyler

-retry EDID read on checksum error
-don't WARN_ON on checksum error, a simple pr_warn will suffice
-try 16bpp framebuffer -> better performance ?

-make twi not register when disabled in fex

-mali clock div is too low in many fex files when not using PLL6 for PLL4

-checkout wemac performance issues, see archived mail

-Silence kernel debug spew in general

-timezone selection in firstboot ?
