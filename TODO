-test at the hackerspace:
 -try wobi-i5 usbc0 in host only mode, commit if works

-F19-r1
 -Should
  -add network config support
  -get wifi on auxtek-t004 to work
  -auxtek-t004 led
 -NTH:
  -add rc.local to tweak cpufreq? :
   http://linux-sunxi.org/Cpufreq
  -look into usb devices not working on A10s without hub ?
  -look into A10s reboot issue (seen on mk802_a10s at 1920x1200)
  -look into high load issue

-A20 support
 -add nand support
 -all other pheriphals
 -Add CONFIG_SUNXI_MULTIPLATFORM Kconfig support
 -Switch to plat include dir?

-the sun7i code dump has many interesting improvements to the emac code, also
 see emac-sun7i-diff-wip (which is incomplete)

-look into using
 https://github.com/ssvb/xf86-video-sunxifb/commits/master

-look into ir support

-install to HD
-install to NAND

-lower fbmem, disable double buffer by default. Freeing 10 MB (useful on
 low mem devices mostly)

-try 16bpp framebuffer -> better performance ?

-rebase rootfs-resize patch, mail to ctyler

-rtc-sun4i, make BACKUP_PWM a runtime check based on ic ver

-sound/soc/sun4i improvements:
 -remove dead ENFORCE_RATES code from sound/soc/sun4i
 -remove dead sun4i_sndhdmi_startup / sun4i_sndhdmi_shutdown from
  sound/soc/sun4i/hdmiaudio/sun4i-sndhdmi.c
 -remove bogus input code for hdmi / spdif ?
 -add full-duplex support to audio-codec + i2s code (take from a13/a10s/a20
  source dumps)
 -according to a10_source_1.5 sun4i hdmi has no rx/tx ctrl just like sun7i

-A10s gpio-int:
 https://github.com/amery/linux-sunxi/commit/e94c07323b3667130eedf1f833c12ccb80fd820d
 Need to fix in gpio-sunxi.c as well

-take photos of devices + create wiki pages so people can easily identify
 which device they have

-mali clock div is too low in many fex files when not using PLL6 for PLL4

-checkout wemac performance issues, see archived mail
