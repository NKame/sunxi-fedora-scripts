-look into high load issue
-look into interlaced without scaler maybe scnwin vs srcwin issue ?
-A10s
-check issues with long kernel cmdline
-chip-id: Unknown (AW1625), for proper code for this see:
 projects/allwinner/a13_source_1.5/lichee/linux-3.0/arch/arm/mach-sun5i/core.c

-use proper functions to calucalate mult + shift for timers
-see if we can do a better sched_clock
-implement a uboot reset for A13 that actually works (use the wdt)

-rebase rootfs-resize patch, mail to ctyler

-retry EDID read on checksum error
-don't WARN_ON on checksum error, a simple pr_warn will suffice
-try 16bpp framebuffer -> better performance ?

-make twi not register when disabled in fex

-mali clock div is too low in many fex files when not using PLL6 for PLL4

-get 10mbit hub, checkout half duplex issue:
 https://github.com/linux-sunxi/linux-sunxi/issues/102
-checkout wemac performance issues, see archived mail

-Silence kernel debug spew in general

-timezone selection in firstboot ?
