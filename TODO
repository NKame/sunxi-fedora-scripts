-rebase rootfs-resize patch, mail to ctyler

-retry EDID read on checksum error
-don't WARN_ON on checksum error, a simple pr_warn will suffice
-try 16bpp framebuffer -> better performance ?

-only register hdmi audio when hdmi is active
-make it possible to have no regular audio-codec
-make twi not register when disabled in fex
-fix hdmi info block, see wip file

WARNING: sound/soc/sun4i/built-in.o(.devinit.text+0x64): Section mismatch in
reference from the function sun4i_codec_probe() to the function
.init.text:snd_chip_codec_mixer_new()
The function __devinit sun4i_codec_probe() references

If snd_chip_codec_mixer_new is only used by sun4i_codec_probe then
annotate snd_chip_codec_mixer_new with a matching annotation.

-Get rid of "pm valid" kernel messages
-Silence kernel debug spew in general
-Disable more services, mask plymouth* since we don't use it anyway, also
 see service start messages on a serial terminal
-Do something with the LEDS on the cubie board, ie light up green LED
 on boot like the build in Android does?

-try to free up reserved memory by disabling unused stuff
-timezone selection in firstboot ?

reserve-mem notes:
-Can do __setup_param("argname", func, func, 1) to get func called with the
 argname-value value string, can do this for all the reservations, except
 for the mali as that runs from a fixup function which runs before
 parse_early_param() (called from arch/arm/kernel/setup.c)

-fbdev needs fb0_framebuffer_num * width * height * bpp / 8 bytes per
framebuffer -> 1920x1080@32bpp with disp_mode = 0 and fb0_framebuffer_num = 2
needs 16M
